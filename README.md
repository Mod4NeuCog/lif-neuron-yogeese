A Repo for the submitted code for Computational Modelling and Simulation for Neurocognitive Systems Course

## Code organization:
- [x] classes 1-2: forward-network.py
  The forward pass of a network with the sigmoid function
- [] classes 3-4: lif-experimental-frame.py
  Use the forward pass network to make a lif neuron
  network. Encompass this in an experimental frame to 
  get network activity.
- [] Markov decision process homework: mdp.py
- [] Value Iteration homework: value-iteration.py
